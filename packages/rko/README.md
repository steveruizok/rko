## Installation

```bash
npm install perfect-freehand
```

or

```bash
yarn add perfect-freehand
```

## Usage

This package's default export is a function that:

- accepts an array of points and an (optional) options object
- returns a stroke outline as an array of points formatted as `[x, y]`

```js
import getStroke from 'perfect-freehand'
```

You may format your input points as array _or_ an object. In both cases, the value for pressure is optional (it will default to `.5`).

```js
getStroke([
  [0, 0, 0],
  [10, 5, 0.5],
  [20, 8, 0.3],
])

getStroke([
  { x: 0, y: 0, pressure: 0 },
  { x: 10, y: 5, pressure: 0.5 },
  { x: 20, y: 8, pressure: 0.3 },
])
```

### Options

The options object is optional, as are each of its properties.

| Property           | Type     | Default | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`             | number   | 8       | The base size (diameter) of the stroke.               |
| `thinning`         | number   | .5      | The effect of pressure on the stroke's size.          |
| `smoothing`        | number   | .5      | How much to soften the stroke's edges.                |
| `streamline`       | number   | .5      | How much to streamline the stroke.                    |
| `simulatePressure` | boolean  | true    | Whether to simulate pressure based on velocity.       |
| `easing`           | function | t => t  | An easing function to apply to each point's pressure. |
| `start`            | { }      |         | Tapering options for the start of the line.           |
| `end`              | { }      |         | Tapering options for the end of the line.             |
| `last`             | boolean  | true    | Whether the stroke is complete.                       |

**Note:** When the `last` property is `true`, the line's end will be drawn at the last input point, rather than slightly behind it.

The `start` and `end` options accept an object:

| Property | Type     | Default | Description                                 |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `cap`    | boolean  | true    | Whether to draw a cap.                      |
| `taper`  | number   | 0       | The distance to taper.                      |
| `easing` | function | t => t  | An easing function for the tapering effect. |

**Note:** The `cap` property has no effect when `taper` is more than zero.

```js
getStroke(myPoints, {
  size: 8,
  thinning: 0.5,
  smoothing: 0.5,
  streamline: 0.5,
  easing: (t) => t * t * t,
  simulatePressure: true,
  last: true,
  start: {
    taper: 20,
    easing: (t) => t * t * t,
  },
  end: {
    taper: 20,
    easing: (t) => t * t * t,
  },
})
```

> **Tip:** To create a stroke with a steady line, set the `thinning` option to `0`.

> **Tip:** To create a stroke that gets thinner with pressure instead of thicker, use a negative number for the `thinning` option.

### Rendering

While `getStroke` returns an array of points representing the outline of a stroke, it's up to you to decide how you will render these points.

The function below will turn the points returned by `getStroke` into SVG path data.

```js
function getSvgPathFromStroke(stroke) {
  if (!stroke.length) return ''

  const d = stroke.reduce(
    (acc, [x0, y0], i, arr) => {
      const [x1, y1] = arr[(i + 1) % arr.length]
      acc.push(x0, y0, (x0 + x1) / 2, (y0 + y1) / 2)
      return acc
    },
    ['M', ...stroke[0], 'Q']
  )

  d.push('Z')
  return d.join(' ')
}
```

To use this function, first use perfect-freehand to turn your input points into a stroke outline, then pass the result to `getSvgPathFromStroke`.

```js
import getStroke from 'perfect-freehand'

const myStroke = getStroke(myInputPoints)

const pathData = getSvgPathFromStroke(myStroke)
```

You could then pass this string either to an [SVG path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d) element:

```jsx
<path d={pathData} />
```

Or, if you are rendering with HTML Canvas, you can pass the result to a [`Path2D` constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D/Path2D#using_svg_paths)).

```js
const myPath = new Path2D(pathData)
ctx.fill(myPath)
```

### Flattening

To render a stroke as a "flattened" polygon, add the [`polygon-clipping`](https://github.com/mfogel/polygon-clipping) package and use the following function together with the `getSvgPathFromStroke`.

```js
import polygonClipping from 'polygon-clipping'

function getFlatSvgPathFromStroke(stroke) {
  const poly = polygonClipping.union([stroke])

  const d = []

  for (let face of poly) {
    for (let points of face) {
      d.push(getSvgPathFromStroke(points))
    }
  }

  return d.join(' ')
}
```

> **Tip:** For implementations in Typescript, see the example project included in this repository.

### Example

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import getStroke from 'perfect-freehand'
import { getSvgPathFromStroke } from './utils'

export default function Example() {
  const [points, setPoints] = React.useState()

  function handlePointerDown(e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    setPoints([[e.pageX, e.pageY, e.pressure]])
  }

  function handlePointerMove(e) {
    if (e.buttons === 1) {
      e.preventDefault()
      setPoints([...points, [e.pageX, e.pageY, e.pressure]])
    }
  }

  return (
    <svg
      onPointerDown={handlePointerDown}
      onPointerMove={handlePointerMove}
      style={{ touchAction: 'none' }}
    >
      {points && (
        <path
          d={getSvgPathFromStroke(
            getStroke(points, {
              size: 24,
              thinning: 0.5,
              smoothing: 0.5,
              streamline: 0.5,
            })
          )}
        />
      )}
    </svg>
  )
}
```

### Advanced Usage

#### `StrokeOptions`

A TypeScript type for the options object.

```ts
import { StrokeOptions } from 'perfect-freehand'
```

For advanced usage, the library also exports smaller functions that `getStroke` uses to generate its SVG data. While you can use `getStroke`'s data to render strokes with an HTML canvas (via the Path2D element) or with SVG paths, these new functions will allow you to create paths in other rendering technologies.

#### `getStrokePoints`

```js
import { strokePoints } from 'perfect-freehand'
const strokePoints = getStrokePoints(rawInputPoints)
```

Accepts an array of points (formatted either as `[x, y, pressure]` or `{ x: number, y: number, pressure: number}`) and a streamline value. Returns a set of streamlined points as `[x, y, pressure, angle, distance, lengthAtPoint]`. The path's total length will be the length of the last point in the array.

#### `getOutlinePoints`

Accepts an array of points (formatted as `[x, y, pressure, angle, distance, length]`, i.e. the output of `getStrokePoints`) and returns an array of points (`[x, y]`) defining the outline of a pressure-sensitive stroke.

```js
import { getOutlinePoints } from 'perfect-freehand'
const outlinePoints = getOutlinePoints(strokePoints)
```
